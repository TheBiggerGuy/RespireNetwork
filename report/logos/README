Files in the "logos" directory:
==============================

Edinburgh University shield:
---------------------------
The file "eushield.eps" contains the Edinburgh University shield. It can be
displayed in five different ways:
    0: regular monochrome
    1: monochrome with no lines in the background
    2: reverse monochrome
    3: two colours: navy and red
    4: full colour
To select an appropriate display technique, use the "eushield" package:
    \usepackage{eushield}
and then use the "\shieldtype" command to select the version of the crest
you want to include:
    \shieldtype{3} % crest will be navy and red
Note that if you are producing PostScript, all the shields will come out
with the characteristics of the last \shieldtype command, since the
different versions are obtained through PostScript "\special" commands in
the DVI file.

The "\eushield" command produces the appropriate filename for including;
for example, using the graphics package:
    \includegraphics{\eushield}
The "\includeshield" command is exactly the same as
"\includegraphics{\eushield}".


Informatics logos:
-----------------
The file "school_of_informatics.eps" and "school_of_informatics.pdf"
contains the School of Informatics logo, for use on official Informatics
documents. The file "GraphicB-pale.eps" and ".pdf" contains the large,
washed-out Informatics "i" for use on posters.


Old files:
---------
The directory "old" contains all of the old logos and shields from previous
installations. These should not be used -- and, indeed, are not used in any
of the current Informatics classes -- but they are kept there for the
benefit of users of old classes.
