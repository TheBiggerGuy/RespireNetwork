\abstract{
The Respire device provides low-power, unobtrusive respiratory monitoring of patients by use of
accelerometers to detect breathing movements. Implementation of a wireless networking capability
for this device will facilitate its widespread use in diagnosis and clinical management of respiratory
disease. The aim of this project was to develop Respire network firmware based on the Time
Division Multiple Access (TDMA) method of network channel access, which was concluded to be the
only large-network (\textgreater 6 device constraint of the Respire hardware) method suitable for the Respire. I
produced and tested operational and debugging firmware for project development, which led to
identification of problems implementing TDMA with the Send-Receive function of the low-power
nRF24 radio onboard the Respire device. This has precluded testing of my design with the Respire
devices in a large-network environment. An important aspect of firmware development was to
include power-saving features where possible (e.g. x\% reduction in power use when implementing
delays relative to code provided by the manufacturer). The project material (firmware, debugging
and testing systems) provides a basis for future development and application of the Respire family of
devices.
